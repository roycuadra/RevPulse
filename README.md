This code represents an experimental project for remotely controlling rapid backfire in a motorcycle.
It utilizes an ESP8266-based device, configured as an access point with a web server. 
Through the web interface, users can control the speed of a relay connected to a GPIO pin, 
thereby influencing the backfire characteristics of the motorcycle. The web interface provides 
options to start/stop the backfire and adjust the relay speed using a slider. The project incorporates
SPIFFS to serve the HTML content, and the 

Default hotspot credentials are "ESP-Relay" with the password "admin12345"
